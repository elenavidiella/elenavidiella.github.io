                    <p> I live a crazy life full of crazy annecdotes </p>
                    
                         <p>
                          I was born in Spain and moved to New Zesland when I was 10 with my family. We lived in Tauranga for 4 years, and then another 4 in Gisborne. I now live in Wellington and have been here for 2 years. I am in my 3rd year of studying fine arts at Massey University. I also work part time as a duty manager at El Matador restaurant. 
                    
                    </p>
                    
                        <p> 
                        For the first time in my life, I am at a point where I know what my life is going to look like for the next 1.5 years. This sense of somewhat relief and comfort has left me with the freedom to contemplate the small things in life without any pressure. I think the exploration within my work at the moment reflects this. 
                    </p>
        
                    
                      
                
                <div class= "IPO"></div>
                    
                    <h1> IPO </h1>
                    
                    <p> I am going to create some paintings around the beautiful glimpses of everyday life that make our days so much better and fill us with innocent joy. Life, as I am sure we have all experienced, is a rollercoaster. I think back to when I was an innocent child and looked at the world in a beautiful light, and as I have grown older, I find even though life may not always be that beautiful, there are little moments in our everyday life’s that trigger that innocent and pure feeling. We should look at art as something we can derive a feeling from, rather and a meaning, that is inclusivity at its core. There is not wrong or right when it comes to perception and feelings. You don’t have to justify feelings; they are the most universal and inclusive way of understanding.  </p>
